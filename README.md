# Movie Trailer Website
This is a programming simple exercise. 

This will launch a web page containing a selection of my favourite movies. The information about each movie, including its poster, comes from OMDb using its API.
Using Bootstrap, the page shows the plot in a tooltip.

I hope you like it ;)

## Launching the webpage

To launch the web page just run:

```python
$ python entertainment_center.py
```
